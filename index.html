		        New Zealand has beautiful scenery and abundant water resources. In tourism, play or outdoor activities, people are more or less exposed to various water sites. However, the they are not always safe: "beautiful swimming holes and beaches can also be deadly".

		        <br/>
		        <br/>
		        <br/>
		     
		        "On Aotearoa’s beaches, the most common hazards are waves, wind, tides and what we call a rip. A rip is a channel of water with a strong current heading out to sea."

		        <br/>
		        <br/>
		        <br/>

		        This app can be a good outdoor assistant of you! “Water Check” can search for the surrounding water sites based on your current location and mark them on the map. All the information (sanitation and safety of the water, etc) will pops up by clicking on the sites you want to view. 

		        <br/>
		        <br/>
		        <br/>

		        Another database for this app is specially designed for swimmers. Click on the button that has a swimmer on it, and after positioning, the map will mark the swimmable water sites around you. By clicking on the sites, you can view the security level of that water area.

				<h3>Lake Submerged Plant Indicators</h3>
				
				<p>

		        Lake Submerged Plant Indicators (Lake SPI) is a method of characterising the ecological health of lakes based on the amount of native and invasive plants growing in them.  Presented as a percentage, higher Lake SPI scores are associated with the better water quality.

				</p>
				<br/>
		        <br/>
		        
			

				<h3>How is Lake SPI measured?</h3>
			
				<p>
					
					Councils, the Department of Conservation and NIWA are all involved in collecting data used to calculate Lake SPI. These agencies carry out surveys of the plants growing under the surface of lakes using scuba divers. The data collected on these surveys is used to determine the:

					Native Condition Index: the percentage of native vegetation within a lake. A high Native Condition Index is desirable.
					
					Invasive Impact Index: the percentage of invasive weeds within a lake. A high Invasive Impact is undesirable.
 					
 					The native condition and invasive impact indices are used together to generate a LakeSPI Index, which provides an overall indicator of lake ecological condition.

				</p>

				<br/>
		        <br/>
		        
			
				<h3>What do the Lake SPI numbers mean?</h3>
			
			    <p>

					The Lake SPI percentage gives an indication of ecological health, the higher the Lake SPI percentage, the better the ecological health of the lake.  Each range of percentages translates into a scientific description as explained in the table below:

				<h3>Lake Trophic Level Index </h3>
				
				<p>

					The Trophic Level Index (TLI) is used on LAWA to give an overall picture of the health of New Zealand lakes. Each lake is assigned a number between 1 and 7, the lower the number, the better the water quality in the lake.

				</p>
			
				<br/>
		        <br/>
		        
				<h3>How is TLI calculated?</h3>
				
				<p>

					The TLI number is calculated using four separate water quality measurements – total nitrogen, total phosphorous, water clarity, and chlorophyll-a.

					Total nitrogen and total phosphorous are nutrients that plants thrive on. Large amounts of these nutrients in the lakes encourage the growth of algae which can lead to poor water quality.

					Water clarity is a measurement of how clear the water in the lake is. In general, the clearer the water, the better the water quality.

					Chlorophyll-a is the green colour in plants. Knowing how much chlorophyll there is in a lake gives us a good idea of how much algae the lake has. It’s okay to have algae in a lake, just not too much. The more algae present, the poorer the water quality.

					The Trophic Level Index combines these four measurements into one number.

				</p>
				
				<h3>What do the TLI numbers mean?</h3>

					The Trophic Level Index gives an indication of lake water quality. Each range of numbers translates into a scientific description as explained below:

					Supertrophic: The lake is fertile and saturated in phosphorus and nitrogen, often associated with poor water clarity
